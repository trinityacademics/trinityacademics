<br>(F) analyze and explain the complementary relationship between the structure and function of objects, organisms, and systems; and
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(G) analyze and explain how factors or conditions impact stability and change in objects, organisms, and systems.
  (6) Matter and energy. The student knows that matter is made of atoms, can be classified according to its properties, and can undergo changes. The student is expected to:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(A) compare solids, liquids, and gases in terms of their structure, shape, volume, and kinetic energy of atoms and molecules;
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(B) investigate the physical properties of matter to distinguish between pure substances, homogeneous mixtures (solutions), and heterogeneous mixtures;
